# Reflection
### 1. Is one of these coding paradigms "better" than the other? Why or why not?
   * I don not think that one of these coding paradigms is "better" than the other because this is all based on preferences. I very much prefers OOP over functional paradigms.
   * Although OOP is longer than functional, OOP allowed me to implemented those variable easier because they were all associated with the parent class (Podracer) rather than creating little bits of functions that all do different things.

### 2. Given the opportunity to work predominantly using either of these coding paradigms, which seems more appealing? Why?
  * In my personal opinions, I think OOP paradigms appealing when using larger sets of data compared to functional paradigms.
  * OOP is a lot more organized compared to functional as stated in question 1, OOP allowed me to create these variables that associate with the parents rather than having bits of function that do all different things.

### 3. Now being more familiar with these coding paradigms, what tasks/features/pieces of logic would be best handled using functional programming? Object Oriented Programming?
  * Functional programming are best used for smaller sets of data
  * OOP are best used for large amount of data, allowing us to reuse them easily

### 4. Personally, which of these styles takes more work to understand? What should be done in order to deepen understanding related to this paradigm?
  * I think OOP requires more work to understand compared to functional but in order to gain those deepend knowledge on the material the best way to do that is to just practice. Go outside the comfort zone and find what you can do to implement OOP into something that you enjoy which can enhance the learning.
